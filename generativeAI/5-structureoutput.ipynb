       "'<think>\\nOkay, so I need to provide details about the movie Inception. Let me start by recalling what I know about it. It\\'s a 2010 film directed by Christopher Nolan, right? The main cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ellen Page. The theme involves dreams and something called \"inception,\" which I think is the act of planting an idea in someone\\'s subconscious. \\n\\nThe plot is probably complex with layers of dreams within dreams. I remember there\\'s a concept where people enter each other\\'s dreams to implant or extract ideas. The technology used might involve a device that connects people\\'s minds, like a neural interface. The main character, Dom Cobb, is a thief who steals secrets by infiltrating the subconscious. The target in this case is a businessman named Robert Fischer, and instead of stealing an idea, they want to plant one. \\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of action and special effects, especially with Joseph Gordon-Levitt\\'s role as Arthur, who does a lot of physical stunts. The movie has a unique visual style, with things like folding cities and rotating rooms. The music is by Hans Zimmer, which adds to the intense atmosphere. \\n\\nThemes might include the nature of reality versus dreams, the power of the subconscious, and personal redemption. The ending is ambiguous, with the spinning top that could fall or keep spinning, leaving the audience wondering if Cobb is still in a dream. There\\'s also a lot about memory, particularly Cobb\\'s deceased wife, Mal, who he can\\'t get over, and how her memory affects his ability to move on. \\n\\nI should also mention the film\\'s critical and commercial success. It won four Academy Awards and was a box office hit. The budget was high, and it was praised for its originality and direction. The structure of the film is non-linear in parts, with multiple timelines and layers of dreams. \\n\\nWait, I need to make sure I\\'m not mixing up details from other Nolan films. For example, in Memento, the structure is non-linear, but Inception has a more layered approach with dreams within dreams. Also, the concept of \"kicks\" to wake up from a dream, like synchronized time or a noise to trigger awakening. \\n\\nI should organize the information into sections like plot, cast, themes, production, reception, and maybe some key elements like the spinning top or the concept of Mal. Also, the role of Arthur and Eames in the heist. The use of practical effects versus CGI, especially with the rotating hallway fight scene. \\n\\nI should check if there are any notable trivia or behind-the-scenes facts. For example, how they created the rotating hallway using a Wally Pfister\\'s camera rig. Or the fact that some scenes were shot in reverse. Also, the film\\'s score was composed by Hans Zimmer, which was a significant part of the film\\'s identity. \\n\\nI need to make sure the details are accurate. The runtime is over two and a half hours, which is quite long for a heist film. The setting is a mix of real and fictional locations, like Paris, Tokyo, and various dreamscapes. The color palette changes with each dream layer—brighter in the first, darker in the second, and cold in the third. \\n\\nAlso, the concept of \"kick\" is a common term in the movie, which refers to the action that causes the dreamer to wake up. There\\'s also the idea of shared dreaming, which requires a precise synchronization of time across layers. The use of totems to verify reality, with Cobb\\'s being the spinning top. \\n\\nIn terms of themes, the movie explores the idea of reality being subjective and the impact of personal guilt and trauma. Cobb\\'s inability to let go of Mal is a central conflict, and the resolution of this is tied to the climax. \\n\\nI should also mention the critical reception—many praised its originality, direction, and performances, though some found it too complicated. The ending\\'s ambiguity sparked a lot of discussion. \\n\\nI need to structure all this information coherently, maybe starting with an overview, then plot, cast, themes, production, and reception. Make sure to clarify any technical terms related to the dream concept, like limbo or the dream layers. Also, highlight key scenes that exemplify the film\\'s unique approach, like the zero-gravity fight or the folding city. \\n\\nWait, I might have confused some elements from The Matrix with Inception. Need to be careful not to mix them up. Inception is more about the manipulation of dreams for a specific purpose, while The Matrix is about a simulated reality. Different concepts but both tackle the nature of reality. \\n\\nAlso, the character of Arthur is the \"architect\" of the dream, designing the dreamscapes, while Eames is the forger who can mimic others. The team members have specific roles to ensure the success of the inception. \\n\\nI should also mention the budget and box office numbers to give a sense of its commercial success. The budget was around $160 million, and it grossed over $800 million worldwide. \\n\\nIn summary, I need to present a detailed yet concise overview of Inception, covering its plot, characters, themes, production aspects, and reception, ensuring accuracy and clarity.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Inception (2010): A Comprehensive Overview**\\n\\n**Director:** Christopher Nolan  \\n**Release Date:** July 16, 2010  \\n**Runtime:** 148 minutes  \\n**Budget:** $160 million  \\n**Box Office:** Over $800 million worldwide  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Plot Summary**\\nInception is a science fiction action film centered on the concept of manipulating dreams to implant or extract ideas. The protagonist, **Dom Cobb** (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a skilled thief who infiltrates the subconscious of targets to steal secrets. In this heist, he is tasked with **inception**—planting an idea—into the mind of **Robert Fischer** (Cillian Murphy), a wealthy businessman.\\n\\n**Key Elements:**\\n- **Dream Layers:** The team navigates multiple dream layers, each with its own time dilation. For example, 1 hour in the first layer equals 6 minutes in the real world.\\n- **Limbo:** A subconscious realm for those lost in perpetual dreaming, often inhabited by memories or trauma.\\n- **Kicks:** Synchronized actions across layers to trigger wakefulness (e.g., a time bomb, a loud noise).\\n- **Totems:** Objects to verify reality (Cobb\\'s is a spinning top; if it stops, he is awake).\\n\\n**Mission Structure:**\\n1. **Extracting Mal (Cobb\\'s Wife):** The team infiltrates Fischer’s subconscious, with Cobb confronting his guilt over Mal\\'s death, caused by her belief they were in a dream.\\n2. **Inception:** They implant the idea that Robert Fischer should dissolve his father’s empire, using dream layers designed by **Arthur** (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and involving **Eames** (Tom Hardy), who mimics others.\\n3. **Climax:** A chaotic fight in a zero-gravity hallway (Arthur\\'s role) and a confrontation with Fischer\\'s subconscious in a decaying Parisian dream.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Cast & Characters**\\n- **Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb:** A guilt-ridden heist leader haunted by his wife\\'s memory.\\n- **Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur:** The team’s logistics expert, known for a gravity-defying fight sequence in a rotating hotel corridor.\\n- **Ellen Page as Ariadne:** A young architect who designs dreamscapes, representing the audience’s guide to the film’s mechanics.\\n- **Tom Hardy as Eames:** A forger who can mimic others, using disguises to navigate dreams.\\n- **Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer:** The target of the inception.\\n- **Tom Berenger as Professor Stephen M. Fischer:** Robert’s father, whose legacy is the target of the heist.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Themes**\\n- **Reality vs. Dreams:** The film challenges the perception of reality, using Cobb’s totem to question his own existence.\\n- **Guilt and Redemption:** Cobb’s trauma over Mal’s death drives the narrative, with her memory symbolizing his inability to move on.\\n- **Collaboration:** The heist requires a team with specialized roles, emphasizing trust and coordination.\\n- **Time and Memory:** Dream layers distort time and memory, reflecting the subconscious’s fluidity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Production & Technical Innovations**\\n- **Direction & Visuals:** Christopher Nolan blended practical effects (e.g., the rotating hallway, shot with a custom-built rig) with CGI (e.g., folding cityscapes).\\n- **Music:** Composed by **Hans Zimmer**, the score features a haunting piano motif that intensifies with each dream layer.\\n- **Cinematography:** Wally Pfister’s work uses color palettes to differentiate dream layers: warm (first layer), cool (second), and desaturated (limbo).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Reception & Legacy**\\n- **Critical Acclaim:** Praised for its originality, complex narrative, and visual effects. It won **4 Oscars** (Best Cinematography, Visual Effects, Sound Mixing, and Sound Editing).\\n- **Cultural Impact:** The ambiguous ending (Cobb’s spinning top) sparked widespread debate, and the film is often cited as a modern classic.\\n- **Awards:** Nominated for 8 Oscars and won numerous other accolades, including BAFTAs and Golden Globes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Scenes & Memorable Elements**\\n- **Zero-Gravity Fight:** Arthur’s fight in a rotating hotel corridor, a hallmark of the film’s practical effects.\\n- **Paris Folding:** A dream layer where buildings fold into impossible geometries, symbolizing the malleability of subconscious space.\\n- **Limbo Sequence:** A visceral depiction of Cobb’s guilt, featuring endless falling'"

The user wants me to extract contact information from the given text: \"Tapan Talukdar, tapan@example.com, (555) 123-4567\". \\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the different parts. The name is straightforward—Tapan Talukdar. Then there\\'s the email address, which is tapan@example.com. The phone number is (555) 123-4567. I should check if the phone number is in the correct format. The function requires name, email, and phone number as parameters. All three are present here. \\n\\nI need to make sure there\\'s no extra information or formatting issues. The email looks valid, and the phone number includes the area code in parentheses followed by the rest of the number. The function\\'s parameters don\\'t specify a particular phone format, so as long as it\\'s a string, it should be okay. \\n\\nSo, I\\'ll structure the JSON object with the name, email, and phone number.
